Create a scene
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the Eighti plugin ( see Installation for steps ) to your existing project
2. Make a folder in Content Browser under ``Content``, naming could be arbitrary.
3. From the Content brower, create a new ``Misc\PAT Asset`` content type and fill in the Remote URI parameter with a path to the hosted content of your choice.
4. From ``Place Actor`` window, search ``PATActor``, or you can scroll down from the ``All Classes`` list, then drag and drop an ``PATActor`` to your scene.
5. Select the ``PATActor`` by clicking the preview mesh associated with it.
6. Navigate to the imported asset in Content Browser, keep it selected.
7. Optionally, press Ctrl-S to save the asset.
8. In the Details Panel, expand the ``PatActor`` options, click the small '<-' button next to the PAT Data Asset. It will assign the asset to the ``PatActor``.
